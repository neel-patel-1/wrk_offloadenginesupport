### Nginx Workload Experiments
* Corresponds to figures 11 and 12 in [SmartDIMM:  In-Memory Acceleration of Upper Layer I/O Protocols Artifact](https://www.hpca-conf.org/2024)<br>

#### Setting up Cloudlab Instances:
To ease reproduction we have created a cloudlab environment and setup closely matching the server configuration used in the HPCA 2024 paper `SmartDIMM:  In-Memory Acceleration of Upper Layer I/O Protocols Artifact`

Following the instructions below will provision a cloudlab instance in which the SPEC 2017 and (de)compression workloads
from the paper will be executed. For more information, refer to [`SmartDIMM:  In-Memory Acceleration of Upper Layer I/O Protocols Artifact`](https://www.HPCA 56.org/)

* allocate a cloudlab instance using the genilib script provided in this repo
	* Create a cloudlab account if needed
	* Navigate to `Experiments`, then `Create Experiment Profile`, and upload `nginx_workload.profile`

#### Artifact Evaluation Instructions:
To ease reproducibility for our artifact evaluators we have provided on-premise access to the servers used to generate the original nginx workload results from the HPCA 2024 paper `SmartDIMM:  In-Memory Acceleration of Upper Layer I/O Protocols Artifact`
* please reach out to the authors if there are any further questions regarding accessing our on-premise hosts
